Native interface
================

The native wrapper follows RELIC's convention of writing operations in G1 and G2 additively, and those in GT multiplicatively. You can use this interface by importing

.. code-block:: python

   from petrelic.native.pairing import G1, G2, GT

petrelic.native.pairing
-----------------------

.. automodule:: petrelic.native.pairing
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :exclude-members: check_same_type
