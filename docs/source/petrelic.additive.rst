Additive interface
==================

The additive wrapper presents an additive interface for all three groups G1, G2, and GT. This is useful, for example, when integrating with `zsks`. You can use this interface by importing:

.. code-block:: python

   from petrelic.additive.pairing import G1, G2, GT


petrelic.additive.pairing
-----------------------

.. automodule:: petrelic.additive.pairing
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :inherited-members:
