Multiplicative interface
========================

The multiplicative interface uses a multiplicative notation for all three groups G1, G2, and GT. This ensures that the notation is closest to that of most cryptography papers. You can use this interface by importing

.. code-block:: python

   from petrelic.multiplicative.pairing import G1, G2, GT

petrelic.multiplicative.pairing
-------------------------------

.. automodule:: petrelic.multiplicative.pairing
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :inherited-members:
    :exclude-members: check_same_type
